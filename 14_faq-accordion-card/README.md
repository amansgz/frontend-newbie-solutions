## 📚 What I Learned

- Leveraged `<details>` and `<summary>` elements for native accordion functionality
- Discovered the `[open]` attribute for state management
- Implemented JavaScript to ensure only one `<details>` element remains open at a time
- Employed `mousemove` event listeners to create custom cursor effects within the accordion container
- Learned to create smooth animations and transitions.
