## 📚 What I Learned

### CSS Methodology Evolution

This project helped me explore alternative CSS architectures beyond traditional BEM:

**Previous approach (BEM):**

- Multiple specific classes
- Higher specificity requirements
- More verbose HTML and CSS

**New approach (Contextual + Utility):**

- Generic classes: `.title`, `.text`
- Styling based on parent context
- Flatter specificity hierarchy
- More reusable and maintainable code

**Benefits observed:**

- Reduced CSS file size
- Faster development iterations
- Easier to maintain consistency
- More flexible component variations
