## 📖 Overview

This project is my solution to the "QR Code Component" from Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size that closely matches the provided design.

Original Challenge: [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

## ✨ Features

- **Perfect Centering:** The QR code card centered both horizontally and vertically on the page using modern Flexbox techniques.
- **Clean and Accesible Code:** The project uses semantic HTML and includes a screen reader-only heading to improve accessibility and provide proper context for assistive technologies.
