# üë©‚Äçüíª Intro component with sign up form

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this introductory component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
