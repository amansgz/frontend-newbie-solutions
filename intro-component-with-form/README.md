## 📖 Overview

This project is my solution to the "Intro component with sign up form" from Frontend Mentor.
The challenge:

- Build the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size that closely matches the provided design.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_
