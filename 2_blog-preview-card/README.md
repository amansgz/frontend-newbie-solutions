## Welcome! 👋

This project is my solution to the "Blog Preview Card" from Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size that closely matches the provided design and See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## 📚 What I Learned

### Development Workflow

- **Figma to Code**: Learning to extract accurate measurements, colors and spacing from design files.
- **Git Best Practices**: Using descriptive branch names and commit messages for better collaboration.

### Web Accessibility

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of `<time datetime="">
` for dates and meaningful HTML structure
- **Reduced motion**: Implementing `prefers-reduced-motion` for users with motion sensitivity
- **Focus Management**: Creating accessible focus states with proper contrast and outline offsets
- **Screen reader support**: Using `role="text` for better text content announcement

### CSS Techniques & Tricks

- **Multiple Box Shadows for Borders**: Used the `box-shadow` property with multiple values to create separate borders without affecting the element's layout.
