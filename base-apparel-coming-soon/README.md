## 📚 What I Learned

**Dynamic Error Handling in Forms**

- Implemented a real-time email validation system with visual feedback.
- Used CSS transitions to smoothly show/hide error messages without layout shifts.
- Positioned the error icon absolutely within the input field for precise placement.
- Manages error states by toggling CSS classes via JavaScript while maintaining accessibility.
- Created a non-intrusive error message that appears below the input without pushing content.
