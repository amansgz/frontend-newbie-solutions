## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem;">
  <div>
    <img style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);" src="./design/mobile-design.jpg" alt=" Preview Card desktop design" width="320">
  </div>
  <div>
    <img style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);" src="./design/desktop-design.jpg" alt=" Preview Card desktop design" width="768">
  </div>
</div>

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

 <div>
    <img style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);" src="./design/active-states.jpg" alt=" Preview Card desktop design" width="768">
  </div>

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
