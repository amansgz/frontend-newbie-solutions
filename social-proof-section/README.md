## 📚 What I Learned

- **Staircase effect implementation:** Using CSS `nth-child` selectors combined with `margin` to create a visually appealing staircase effect.
- **Dynamic star rating generation:** Creating SVG star elements for all rating components. This approach allows easy scalability if different ratings were needed in the future.
