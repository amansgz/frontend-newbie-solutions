## üìñ Overview

This project is my solution to the "Ping Coming Soon Page" from Frontend Mentor.

The challenge:

- Build the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size that closely matches the provided design.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## üìö What I Learned

### Accesibility & Semantic HTML

- **Visually hidden labbels:** Used `sr-only` class to hide label from sighted users while keeping them accessible for screen readers.
- **SVG accessibility:** Added `role="img"` and `<title>` elements to social icons for proper screen reader announcement.
- **Form validation:** Implemented accesible error messages that are announced to screen readers.

### CSS Techniques

- **Social media hover effects:** Created rounded background effects using `background-color` + `border-radius` on social links instead of modifying the SVG itself.
- **Custom form validation:** Styled validation states with custom error messages and visual feedback.
- **Responsive design:** Used mobile-first approach and CSS Flexbox for layout adaptability.

### JavaScript Insights

- **Form validation logic:** Built custom email validation with regex instead of relying solely on HTML5 validation.
- **Event handling:** Learned to use `submit` event on forms instead of `click` on buttons for better accessibility.
- **User experience:** Implemented timed success messages and button state management for better feedback.
