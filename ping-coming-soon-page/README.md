## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; padding-bottom: 1.5rem;">
  <div>
    <img style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);" src="./design/mobile-design.jpg" alt=" Preview Card desktop design" width="320">
  </div>
  <div>
    <img style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);" src="./design/desktop-design.jpg" alt=" Preview Card desktop design" width="768">
  </div>
</div>

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

 <div>
    <img style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);" src="./design/desktop-hover-error-states.jpg" alt="error and hover states" width="768">
  </div>

- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources
